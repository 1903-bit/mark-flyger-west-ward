With over 24 years as CFO of the Modern Transport Group – a major manufacturer operating across New Zealand and Australia – I bring real financial experience to the Council table.
I am also part owner of Biddy Mulligans Irish Pub on Hood Street, so I understand the real-world challenges facing our central city and small business community.
Earlier in my career, I worked as a tax inspector with the IRD in Hamilton, then worked for Deloitte in London, in FX commodity markets, and for UK research giant AGB. I later joined Arthur Young in Auckland and Lowndes Ryan in Hamilton.
I have worked with Council for over two decades and know where the problems lie. Missed opportunities, poor financial oversight, and inefficiencies are costing Hamilton.
If elected, I will bring strong financial acumen, tough but realistic budgeting, and a commitment to fiscal responsibility. Let us build a city we can be proud of.
